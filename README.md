# CRAP

Note: This is a project forked from ([github.com/reynhout/chrx](https://github.com/reynhout/chrx)). We are simply updating it to remove the Linux installation feature as it is outdated. Instead, CRAP is only a partitioning tool for chromeOS. This does not have the Linux Install feature, you will have to linux yourself.

|**works on**|All Chromebook models. See [Docs](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/supported-devices.html).|

## usage

Installing Linux via **chrx** onto a new (or freshly recovered) Chromebook

- The first phase reserves space on your storage device for
the new operating system, **and then reboots**.

### step-by-step

1. **Enable [Developer Mode](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices)**
    * (for most models, press `ESC+F3(Refresh)+Power`)
1. **Boot ChromeOS and open Terminal**
    * Press `CTRL+D` at the white "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" (or "OS verification is OFF") screen
    * Configure Wi-Fi and log in (Guest account is fine)
    * Open ChromeOS Terminal by pressing `CTRL+ALT+T`, and entering `shell` at the prompt
1. **Update firmware, if necessary** -- see [chromebooks](#chromebooks)
    * Open Virtual Terminal 2 using ```[ Ctrl ] [ Alt ] [ â†’ ]```
    * run MrChromebox's Firmware Utility Script see ([Firmware Script](https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript))
    * Select ```Install/Update RW_LEGACY Firmware```
1. **Download and run chrx**
    * *add install link here*
1. **Follow on-screen instructions** to allocate storage space for Linux
    * CRAP will suggest dedicating as much space as possible to Linux, and as little as necessary for ChromeOS. Choose your allocation ratio according to your personal requirements and preferences!
